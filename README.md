# Mini_Project_Naive_Bayes.ipynb
Basic Text Classification with Naive Bayes - In the mini-project, we'll learn the basics of text analysis using a subset of movie reviews from the rotten tomatoes database. We'll also use a fundamental technique in Bayesian inference, called Naive Bayes. This mini-project is based on Lab 10 of Harvard's CS109 class.
